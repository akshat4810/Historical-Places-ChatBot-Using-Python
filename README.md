# Historical-Places-ChatBot-Using-Python
Welcome to the Historical Places ChatBot project! This repository contains a Flask-based web application featuring an interactive chatbot that provides information about historical places. The chatbot is designed to respond to user queries with detailed descriptions and historical context for various significant locations.

# Features
- Interactive Chat Interface: Users can type questions about historical places and receive informative responses.
- Randomized Typing Simulation: The chatbot simulates a more natural conversation by varying its typing speed.
- Comprehensive Training Data: The chatbot is trained using a dataset of historical places and their descriptions, making it capable of answering a wide range of questions about different locations.
- Flask Web Framework: The application is built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework.
- Bootstrap for Styling: The front-end interface is styled with Bootstrap to ensure a clean and responsive design.

# Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main application file that sets up the Flask server, chatbot, and routes.
- `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the chat interface.
- `places.txt`: A text file containing the list of historical places and their descriptions used to train the chatbot.
